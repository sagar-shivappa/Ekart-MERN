# MERN : School Management System
## Project Overview

This project outlines the development of a school management system using the MERN Stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js). The application allows administrators to manage student data in a digital and efficient manner.

## Project Goal

The goal is to create a web application with the following functionalities:

- Add new students with details like first name, last name, and email.
- View a list of all registered students.
- Retrieve details of a specific student by searching with their ID.
- Delete student records from the system.

Please refer to the [backend/BACKEND_README.md](backend/BACKEND_README.md) & [frontend/FRONTEND_README.md](frontend/FRONTEND_README.md) to find the respective project instructions.
